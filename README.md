# StackOverflow Auto Error Searching Tool for Python
This is a small repository that can be used to identify errors and search stackoverflow for solutions automatically(python). Just use the search_error() function. It will run the program, find the error, and open stackoverflow pages relevant to the error if there is one.
Just add the file location as the first parameter and the maximum number of related solutions required(by default 5).

Hope This Helps!
